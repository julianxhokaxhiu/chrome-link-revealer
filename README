DESCRIPTION: Show URLs when you hover over links into a webpage.

HOW DOES IT WORK:
This extension will show up the url of the link you're going to click.

You are probably asking yourself why this extenions was made for...well this,
believe it or not, were made because modern browsers like Google Chrome are
going to hide at the most the status bar of the url you're going to click.
So i hope with this that you're going to know more where are you going to
surf to, with some nice SEO tools that i'm sure you will appreciate.
